# Tailscale

**Tailscale** is a peer-to-peer (P2P) VPN solution built on top of WireGuard, designed to simplify secure remote access.  
It creates a private mesh network between devices, allowing them to communicate directly without complex VPN configurations or firewall changes. https://tailscale.com/

## My Opinion

Tailscale is one of the **simplest and most effective VPN solutions** I have used for remote access.  
Its ease of implementation across all major operating systems makes it a go-to choice for quickly connecting devices without complex configuration.

### Why I like Tailscale:
- üåç **Cross-platform simplicity** ‚Äî works on Linux, Windows, macOS, iOS, Android, and more with minimal setup.  
- üõ† **Centralized admin console** ‚Äî structuring and managing access for all devices is straightforward and intuitive.  
- ‚ú® **Magic DNS** ‚Äî eliminates the need to remember IP addresses when connecting to remote devices, making remote sessions seamless.  
- üîí **Zero Trust access** ‚Äî integrates authentication and access control at the network level.

For me, when I need to connect to my infrastructure remotely, **Tailscale is my go-to solution** for its speed of deployment and simplicity.  

However, when transferring large files (e.g., to Nextcloud), I prefer using a **WireGuard VPN** because it offers significantly higher performance.  
Tailscale is excellent for access and control, but it is not designed for high-speed file transfers.
