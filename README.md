# Homelab Portfolio

This repository gathers and documents various projects developed (or currently in progress) as part of my personal **homelab journey, which started in 2020**.  
While I have been experimenting, testing, and learning in my homelab for several years, I have **recently decided to start documenting my work** in a structured way, to both track my progress and share it as a portfolio.
